# libMCdev

a library to speed up development across all my mods by:
1. symplifying unessecary re-usable code.
2. being a portable drop-in API.
3. provide additional helpers with tedious features.


## What will this be used for?

Currently, this is being used as a quick hacky replacement for all my mods' logging solutions, but will likely grow into a tool over time.

This library is under Apache 2.0, feel free to Jar-in-Jar this mod.
